	abstract = {During early stages of design of large scale engineering systems, such as ships, competing objectives of multiple discipline analyzers must be taken into account. Currently, tools such as Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) provide an automated method for analyzing trade-offs between competing discipline design objectives. While automated design methods are useful in the design world, automation removes the human ability to interpret results of analysis. Current design tools lack the ability to incorporate the intent of experienced designers in the communication between disciplines, so MDO results are dependent on the fidelity of the analysis models being used rather than human input. When evaluating designs, a team of experienced engineers communicates information about the design space to each other with respect to their own disciple's objectives and design constraints. This thesis presents a new method of MDO which provides a framework to emulate the intent of an human designer in a MDO optimizer. The method uses the ideas of managing trade-offs and modeling discipline interactions from MDO. Typical MDO algorithms utilize a system level optimizer, which receives information from discipline optimizers and moves toward a globally optimal solution. Generally, the information communicated to the system level optimizer is point data about the individual discipline's optimal point, which is then interpreted as the potential improvement from the current system design state. The proposed algorithm would communicate the discipline's preferred areas of the design space to be combined with the other discipline's preferences in an attempt to find a globally optimal solution. This design intent modeling is introduced through fuzzy logic systems and fuzzy logic controllers. Fuzzy logic systems provide a method to interpret design analysis tools and glean more information to use in the decision making process. Fuzzy logic controllers are often used to emulate human decision models in the control of physical systems. These methods are extended to evaluation of designs to combine data from multiple disciplines to find the optimal system design while considering trade-offs between multiple disciplines. This dissertation will present the development of a novel method of MDO which incorporates fuzzy logic systems and controllers in the MDO optimizer.},

	abstract = {Cost growth and schedule delays frequently impact the design of naval vessels as well as other physically-large and complex products. In vessel design, many instances of cost growth, performance loss, and delays occur suddenly and are unexpected, causing significant damage to an acquisition program. These outcomes are not caused by physical product failure. Instead, they are symptoms of design failures and are characterized by emergent rework, inability to integrate disparate information, and unexpected design difficulty. Design failures emerge from learning and decision-making that occurs during a design activity. In naval acquisitions, failures are frequently caused by the complexity of the naval design activity. Design approaches, processes, methods, and tools attempt to manage this complexity, but no methods exist to address it directly. To address the root-cause of design failures, new capabilities are needed to understand the knowledge-based relationships that drive their emergence. This thesis proposes a Knowledge-Action-Decision (K-A-D) Framework that enables a knowledge-centric perspective of design. The K-A-D Framework decomposes design into an endogenous knowledge structure that describes the changing relationships between the ideas, concepts, and evidence designers use to progress a design activity. Analysis of the K-A-D Framework through a network representation allows the importance of knowledge structure elements to be measured, the trajectory of a design activity to be identified, and opportunities to prevent design failures to be found. The K-A-D Framework, its network representation, and network analysis provide insight into the complex design dynamics that create unexpected design outcomes. First, results and methods from design science and the study of path dependence are synthesized to create the theoretical basis of the K-A-D Framework. The framework is constructed to capture the temporal relationships in knowledge structure development that can ingrain and lock-in design outcomes through path dependence. Second, the framework is applied to investigate the complex behaviors of an agent designing a solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem. Using network analysis of the K-A-D Framework, the agent's solution development and decision-making behaviors are identified and, in some cases, predicted. Third, the knowledge-centric perspective is applied to a naval distributed system design scenario by using the framework to define an approximate knowledge structure for distributed system integration. Finally, ensemble analysis is used to investigate the potential distributed system design knowledge structure characteristics under different early-stage design conditions. Examining the knowledge structure characteristics identifies design conditions that have elevated risk for late-stage design failures. Analysis of path dependence in the knowledge structure development identifies conditions where the risk of failure may be reduced by decisions made by the designer during the distributed system design activity.},

	abstract = {One of the major problems facing ship design today is that engineers often focus most of their efforts on the What of the design as opposed to understanding the Why. The What is defined as the solution itself, while the Why is defined as the decisions that drive how the set of solutions change through time. Decision making through time, especially in the face of uncertainty, has consistently been difficult for engineers. This is due to both uncertainty and the interconnected nature of complex decision making problems. There are no standard definitions or metrics that quantify the impact of engineering design decisions. This dissertation aims to address that need. This research extends the ship-centric Markov decision process (SC-MDP) framework which involves applying Markov decision processes to ship design and decision making. The SC-MDP framework is useful for analyzing decision making in the maritime domain due to its inherent temporal structure and ability to handle uncertainty. However, the framework is limited in its ability to clearly show how uncertainty affects decisions, and its inability to quantify the changes and long term implications of decisions. Two methods unique to this research are developed and explored. First, applying Monte Carlo simulations to the SC-MDP framework is proposed to give insight into the impacts of uncertainty on the decisions and set of results. Second, a method to perform eigenvalue spectral analysis within the framework was developed to understand the behavior of the decisions themselves. Three metrics are developed in regards to eigenvalue analysis. To quantify changes in decisions, the damping ratio is proposed, defined as the ratio of the largest eigenvalue to the magnitude of the second largest. To understand the long term implications of a set of decisions the principal eigenvector is presented. For eliciting relationships and inter-dependencies of decisions, analyzing repeated dominant eigenvalues and the set of principal eigenvectors are used. Three maritime case studies are presented that demonstrate the utility of these methods and metrics involving designing for evolving Emission Control Area regulations, ship egress analysis and general arrangements design, and lifecycle planning for ballast water treatment regulations.},

	abstract = {Acquisitions fail due to complex interactions between many domains. Typical research focuses on one domain or another, e.g. process, product or organization. Systems Engineering is responsible for the bigger picture, but the complexity of naval acquisition still presents major challenges. Potential problems must be identified before mitigating their effects, requiring a complete comprehension of acquisition structure, predictive methods and lead indicators. The structure and challenges of design are a microcosm of acquisition; through multiple levels of context and increasing scale, fundamental relationships affect the outcome of a design, and thus acquisition as a whole. This thesis broadens the application of network theory for naval design from the analysis of physical systems to the general structure of design. The primary contribution is a network structure to represent the multiple domains of design simultaneously and in context, supported by unique methods for analysis and verification. Specifically, a contextual multipartite network approach to represent the structure of naval design is developed with the application and extension of network mathematics, providing meaningful predictive insight. An algorithm for finding path lengths is adapted to quantitatively capture node to node influence across multipartite design networks, showing equivalency with a first order Taylor series expansion. The algorithm, termed path influence, is applied to predict the behavior of a ship design optimization formulation and verified using a full factorial design of experiments. A new metric, Winston centrality, is presented to compare the results of the algorithm with standard network centrality metrics. The flow of information across a design network is modeled with a continuous analogy based on Fick's second law of diffusion. Discrete information flows are then approximated using a version of the path influence algorithm, verified using discrete event simulation.},

	abstract = {Shipbuilding is a unique industry that uses a wide variety of manufactured components and requires a large number of workers possessing various skills as well as specialized facilities. In recent decades, the U.S. Naval shipbuilding industry has faced challenges of building ships on-time and within budgeted cost. The main problems in Naval ship production are high variability in production workload, ineffective production control, and low facility utilization. Our research emphasizes an innovative production system design and control to improve the shipbuilding production performance. We introduce (1) operational flexibility at the execution level and (2) the release policy Constant Work in Process (CONWIP) concepts at strategic level to shipbuilding. The systems are formulated as flexible queueing networks, and Markov Decision Process (MDP) approach is applied to gain structural insights into the optimal control policy and to optimize the key performance measures such as cost, throughput, and cycle time. Results show that the flexibility bring the robustness to the system which mitigates the variability of the block processing time and also achieve a quicker response to the workload change. We also develop efficient control policies to control the flexible resource which minimize the average holding cost of ship blocks and also improve the system throughput. Another research area we investigate is the outfitting process in shipbuilding. The outfitting refers to the process of fabrication and installation of non-structural components, and represents as much as 50\% of the cost of the ship, and up to 50\% of ship construction time in many instances. However, due to disturbances from unexpected delays, system variations, capacity limitations, and technological constraints, scheduling of outfitting processes is very complex and can delay the entire ship production system. Therefore, a strategic level planning model and a dynamic control model are developed to provide analytical information which improves the planning and controlling of the outfitting process.},

	abstract = {Naval ships are some of the most complex systems ever engineered. The process by which they are designed is similarly complex. The complexity and disjointedness of this process leads to the creation of disparate and incomplete ship design information created by different systems of analysis, completed by different design groups, using different tools, at different levels of fidelity. Distributed system design decisions based off this disparate and incomplete information lead to unnecessary complexity when the design is transitioned from the early design stage to the detailed design stage. This dissertation presents novel network theory-based methods for better understanding and analyzing the implications of early stage distributed system design decisions. This new method introduces network theory concepts such as degree distribution, system interdependence, and community to the field of distributed systems design as metrics for determining system robustness, as well as develops new techniques for representing physical systems as networks. Additionally, a personnel movement modeling and analysis method, derived from the network concept of betweenness centrality, is developed. This dissertation documents the first use of multislice and multiplex structures in the analysis of physical systems. System design evolutions are analyzed using multislice network structures and the interactions between systems are investigated using multiplex network structures. These two structures are combined into a novel time-dependent multiplex network structure that is developed in this work. This new structure is used to track the evolution of systems interactions. A new network complexity metric based on the concepts of planarity and network communities is created for this research in a response to lack of methods for studying the planar and near planar networks that often arise in the study of real systems. The methods presented in this dissertation do not require complex 3D CAD models or simulations. Therefore, they can be used by a single naval architect to gain insight into the implications of design decisions in the early design stages. This will result in improved naval distributed systems designs that are easier to design, maintain, and upgrade.},

	abstract = {Humans have a natural ability to operate in dynamic environments and perform complex tasks with little perceived effort. An experienced ship designer can intuitively understand the general consequences of design choices and the general attributes of a good vessel. A person's knowledge is often ill-structured, subjective, and imprecise, but still incredibly effective at capturing general patterns of the real-world or of a design space. Computers on the other hand, can rapidly perform a large number of precise computations using well-structured, objective mathematical models, providing detailed analyses and formal evaluations of a specfic set of design candidates. In ship design, which involves generating knowledge for decision-making through time, engineers interactively use their own mental models and information gathered from computer-based optimization tools to make decisions which steer a vessel's design. In recent decades, the belief that large synthesis codes can help achieve cutting-edge ship performance has led to an increased popularity of optimization methods, potentially leading to rewarding results. And while optimization has proven fruitful to structural engineering and the aerospace industry, its applicability to early-stage design is more limited for three main reasons. First, mathematical models are by definition a reduction which cannot properly describe all aspects of the ship design problem. Second, in multidisciplinary optimization, a low-fidelity model may incorrectly drive a design, biasing the system level solution. Finally, early-stage design is plagued with limited information, limiting the designer's ability to develop models to inform decisions. This research extends previously done work by incorporating type-2 fuzzy logic into a human-centric multidisciplinary optimization framework. The original framework used type-1 fuzzy logic to incorporate human expertise into optimization models through linguistic variables. However, a type-1 system does not properly account for the uncertainty associated with linguistic terms, and thus does not properly represent the uncertainty associated with a human mental model. This limitation is corrected with the type-2 fuzzy logic multidisciplinary optimization presented in this work, which more accurately models a designer's ability to "communicate, reason and make rational decisions in an environment of imprecision, uncertainty, incompleteness of information and partiality of truth" (Mendel et al., 2010). It uses fuzzy definitions of linguistic variables and rule banks to incorporate "human intelligence" into design models, and better handles the linguistic uncertainty inherent to human knowledge and communication. A general mathematical optimization proof of concept and a planing craft case study are presented in this dissertation to show how mathematical models can be enhanced by incorporating expert opinion into them. Additionally, the planing craft case study shows how human mental models can be leveraged to quickly estimate plausible values of ship parameters when no model exists, increasing the designer's ability to run optimization methods when information is limited.},

	abstract = {Humans have a reliable basic probabilistic intuition. We utilize our probabilistic intuition in many day-to-day activities such as driving. In fact any interaction that occurs in the presence of other independent actors requires some probabilistic assessment. While we are good at sorting between rare and common events, determining if these events are statistical significant is always subject to scrutiny. Quite often the bounds of statistical significance are at ends with the ‘common sense’ expectation. While our probabilistic intuition is good for first moment effects such as driving a car, throwing a football and understanding simplistic mathematical models, our probabilistic intuition fails when we need to evaluate secondary effects such as high speed turns, playing golf or understanding complex mathematical models. When our probabilistic intuition is challenged misinterpretation of results and skewed perspectives of possible outcomes will occur. The work presented in this dissertation provides a mathematical formulation that will provide a guide to when our probabilistic intuition will be challenged. This dissertation will discuss the development of the Process Failure Estimation Technique (ProFET). A multitude of potential team parameters could have been selected, interpersonal communication effectiveness and cognitive skill assessments seemed the most obvious first steps. This is due to the prolific discussion on communication and the general acceptance of the cognitive testing as an indicator of performance potential. The teams skill set must be variable with respect to time in order to accomplish the required objectives of each phase of the design process. ProFET develops a metric for the design process that is sensitive to the team composition and structure. This metric is applied to a domain that is traditionally devoid of objective scoring. With the use of ProFET more informed decisions on team structure and composition can be made at critical junctions of the design process. Specifically, ProFET looks at how variability propagates through the design activities as opposed to attempting to quantify the actual values of design activities, which is the focus of the majority of other design research.},

	abstract = {A novel set reduction decision support framework for large-scale, team-based design efforts is presented. The framework provides a design manager with valuable and easy-to-understand information that is used to make better informed reduction decisions within a set-based design (SBD) environment. SBD is a convergent design method that uses dominance and infeasibility to consider multiple design alternatives in parallel while accommodating separate groups of specialists within a concurrent engineering approach. Based on the limitations of current SBD research and the completion of extensive design experiments, three major set reduction considerations are identified: time-dependent design relationships, the impact of reduction decisions, and identifying robust reduction decisions. Design relationships change as the fidelity of analysis increases, variable set-ranges are reduced, or requirement changes are instituted. Due to these changing conditions, the impact of reduction decisions can be difficult to determine. Although SBD has proven resilient to changing circumstances, the reduction process can still be impact the design process to the point of potential failure. Identifying robust reduction decisions avoids situations where changes lead to a design failure. Each of the three considerations set forth is addressed by a specific component of the overall decision support framework used to analyze a specific function of interest. Design space mapping is used to determine relationships between variable and function spaces. The Longest Path Problem (LPP) formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) is used as a structure for the reduction decision-making process and the identification of optimal decision paths. Through simulation, robust decision paths are identified. Since the developed LPP MDP formulation has never been used to analyze set reduction problems, multiple metrics and representations are developed using the MDP and simulation results. Based on a series of studies, the MDP LPP framework is able to better handle situations with changing conditions, as well as better accommodate constrained problems, compared to a method based solely on current in-state knowledge. As part of a ship design case study, the framework’s ability to handle multiple and more complicated functions is shown. Also, how the framework fits into a more realistic reduction scenario is presented.},

	abstract = {A constant trend in U.S. Navy design and acquisition programs has been the emphasis on flexible systems and architectures. Modularity and design-for-upgradability are two examples of this trend. Given the increasing importance of flexibility in Naval design, the methods used for valuing Naval assets should adequately capture the impact of such flexibility. Current static budgetary techniques and net present value (NPV) analysis underestimate the value of the embedded ``optionality'' of flexible design features. The use of real options analysis (ROA) has been proposed to correct this underestimation, however the theory is not universally applicable to the naval domain because of key assumptions made by a real options approach. These deficiencies leave designers and decision makers to rely on their intuition and engineering experience when evaluating flexible systems and architectures. A quantitative evaluation framework would add valuable analytical rigor to increasingly complex designs and demanding mission requirements. This research presents a novel framework for evaluating flexible Naval assets, called prospect theory-based real options analysis (PB-ROA). The framework abstracts the principles of ROA to suit a wide variety of naval applications. Since naval assets do not generate cash flows, utility theory provides the alternative measure of value within PB-ROA. However, without a market where the assets are traded, a new source for data on prevailing risk tolerances in needed to properly adjust the option's value according to uncertainty. Where some prior research relies solely on utility curves to determine risk aversion, PB-ROA uses a unique mechanism inspired by Prospect Theory to derive the risk-adjusted probability measure from the decision maker's marginal utility curve(s). This enables PB-ROA to include the impact of loss aversion where previously it has been ignored. Game theory is also incorporated into PB-ROA to address the unique characteristic of some naval options which may be leveraged to influence the behavior of other agents in the Navy's environment. With game theory, PB-ROA lends a new perspective on the value of ``game changing'' options, which do not simply react to changes in the environment, but exert a feedback effect on it as well.},

	abstract = {In recent years, automated approaches for creating ship general arrangements in early-stage design have been developed. These approaches seek to avoid “black box” implementations by keeping the designer involved in the layout generation and selection process, but they do not avoid it entirely. Existing methods first generate layouts, next evaluate each layout’s quality, and subsequently filter out poor designs in an iterative process. In addition, desires to move toward full distributed system layouts in early-stage design have only led to more highly-refined CAD-style implementations requiring extensive modeling and computation time. This dissertation asserts that there is a need to shift away from the current trajectory toward higher-fidelity three-dimensional layout models and re-vector toward a perspective that focuses on understanding and inherently respects the fundamental underlying relationships among elements within those models. The research offered in this thesis uses network science to envision the layout problem from a new perspective. In this view, design relationships are information inputs into layout-related analyses rather than only post-processors for evaluating layouts. This is consistent with existing design processes in which human designers attempt to keep relevant relationships in the back of their mind at all times to inform decisions. Network nodes represent ship compartments and edges correspond to design constraints forming a relationship network. First, network concepts of centrality and hierarchy are used to highlight and rank the embedded drivers of an early-stage arrangement prior to developing spatial layouts by directly analyzing the relationship network in a methodical and holistic manner. The obscured design intent of a notional WWII naval vessel is exposed using the hierarchical approach. Second, a network partitioning method is used to cluster shipboard elements into communities of mutually-compatible elements to minimize the degradation of other items located in the same region of the ship. These communities can form the basis of functional zone definitions. Varying the number of partitions reveals a multi-scale depiction of the relationship network. Third, the communities are assigned to structural zones based on cumulative zone preference values. Finally, two new visualization techniques help designers establish connections between the network of inter-element relationships and spatial ship arrangements.},

	abstract = {A novel design evaluation framework is offered to improve early stage design decisions relating to environmental policy change and similar non-technical disturbances. The goal of this research is to overcome the traditional treatment of policy as a static, external constraint and to address in early stage design the potential disruptions to performance posed by regulatory policy change. While a designer’s primary purpose is not to affect policy, it is the responsibility of the designer to be cognizant of how policy can change, of how to assess the implications of a policy change, and of how to deliver performance despite change. This research addresses a present need for a rigorous means to keep strategic pace with policy evolution. Use of a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework serves as a unifying foundation for incorporating temporal activities into early stage design considerations. The framework employs probabilistic methods via a state-based structure to holistically address policy uncertainty. Presented research enables exploration of the performance of a design solution through time in the face of environmental instabilities and identifies decisions necessary to negotiate path dependencies. The outcome of this research is an advanced framework for addressing life cycle management needs that arise due to policy change, as judged from a life cycle cost perspective. Original metrics for evaluating decision paths provide insight into how the timing, location, and confluence of disturbances impact design decisions. Development of the metrics is driven by a desire to communicate the design-specific characteristics of a strategic response to policy change. Quantifying the amount and type of uncertainty present, changeability afforded, and life cycle changes exercised offer points of comparison among individual design solutions. The knowledge gained from path-centric measurements enables an enhanced ability to characterize design lock-in. Principles and metrics borne out of the design evaluation framework are validated through two ship design examples related to ballast water treatment and carbon emissions.},

The first method utilized a type-1 fuzzy logic system to facilitate set-based design practices and possessed no uncertainty modeling. The next two methods included representation of design uncertainty in the set-based design space. Of these two methods, one utilized a novel approach that harnessed techniques of randomization to model an interval type-2 fuzzy logic system, the other method made use of general type-2 fuzzy logic methods that were well-known, but still relatively under-utilized in academics and industry when compared to type-1 fuzzy logic systems. Comparisons of the newly developed fuzzy logic systems with each other, and the type-1 agent based fuzzy logic system provided the basis for conclusions as to the effects of introducing uncertainty modeling into a set-based design process. The results of this experimental research have shown that the inclusion of uncertainty modeling in the set-based design process for the negotiation of design variables enhances the overall set-based design progression, especially when working with highly constrained designs. In the case of a highly constrained design, the type-1 fuzzy logic system was unable to promote set-convergence within the allotted experimental time without repeated design failures, while the use of uncertainty modeling allowed the interval type-2 modeling and general type-2 fuzzy logic systems to achieve feasible set-based design convergence. When performing a simplistic, loosely constrained design, all three fuzzy logic systems were capable of facilitating the principle practices of set-based design within the feasible solution space; specifically, the set-based practices of delaying design decisions and gradual reduction of the feasible solution space. This research has led to the enhancement of the set-based design process by providing capabilities to now represent uncertainty in the set-based design space though the use of either the newly developed interval type-2 or general type-2 fuzzy logic systems.},
